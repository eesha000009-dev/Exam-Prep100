Task: Update CBT question files with extracted questions

Work Log:
- Analyzed existing question file structure (questions.js format with jambQuestions object)
- Examined CBT HTML to understand how questions are rendered
- Created comprehensive Python extraction scripts
- Extracted questions from PDFs using pymupdf
- Generated questions.js file with all subjects
- Images folders were created but images need to be extracted from PDFs

Stage Summary:
- Questions are in questions.js file with proper format
- Individual subject files exist: english-questions.js, maths-questions.js, physics-questions.js, economics-questions.js, chem-questions.js, biology-questions.js
- Images folders exist under students/cbt/images/ but are currently empty
- CBT HTML already supports images via question.image property
- Need actual PDF files to extract images from

Task: Fix image associations in CBT question files

Work Log:
- Fetched latest code from GitHub (eesha000009-dev/Exam-Prep100, main branch)
- Discovered the root cause: PDF extraction script assigned ALL questions on a page the SAME image, regardless of whether each question actually had a diagram
- Example: Questions 3-7 on page 3 all got `physics_p3_i1.jpeg`, but only one might have a diagram
- Created fix script to identify questions that reference diagrams using keyword analysis
- Keywords checked: "diagram above", "figure shows", "graph shows", etc.
- Fixed files:
  - physics-questions.js: 390 questions, 175 originally had images → 22 correctly kept (153 removed)
  - maths-questions.js: 354 questions, 160 originally had images → 29 correctly kept (131 removed)
  - english-questions.js: 678 questions, 1 originally had images → 0 kept (no diagram refs)
  - economics-questions.js: 979 questions, 14 originally had images → 2 correctly kept (12 removed)
  - chem-questions.js: 410 questions, no image issues
  - biology-questions.js: Already empty, left as-is per user request

Stage Summary:
- Total: 2811 questions processed
- 350 questions originally had images
- 53 questions actually reference diagrams → kept their images
- 297 questions had incorrect image associations → images set to null
- Images now only show for questions that actually reference diagrams
- Files saved in js/*.js.fixed and then renamed to replace originals
